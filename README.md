# generator-marionette-modules [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rek/generator-marionette-modules.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rek/generator-marionette-modules)

> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator. For scaffolding a Marionette app with the Module pattern.


## Getting Started

Lots of decisions have been made for you. This is not so flexable at the moment.
> We like things like: less, dust, requirejs and mocha.

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, this one created the one talked about above.

To install generator-marionette-modules from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-marionette-modules
```

Then initiate the generator:

```
$ yo marionette-modules
```

Finally, to generate a module for our app, simply run:

```
$ yo marionette-modules:module moduleName
```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced. Though not this generator, for that you will need to raise an issue here.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
